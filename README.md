# Text detected OCR Website

This is a website that can detect fonts in images. Simply upload an image, and it will identify the fonts within it.
\
If you prefer not to upload images, this website also supports uploading via image URLs.

## Introduction

When you enter this website, you'll see a simple homepage.
\
In the center of the homepage are two buttons: one for uploading images and the other for image links.
\
In the bottom-left corner of the website, you can switch between light and dark themes.

## Vite + React

This website's frontend utilizes Vite + React for development. React is a free, open-source framework well-suited for building websites.
\
Vite serves as the frontend content for the website, enabling its creation and deployment in React format.
