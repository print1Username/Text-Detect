# Text detected OCR Website

This is a website that can detect fonts in images. Simply upload an image, and it will identify the fonts within it.
\
If you prefer not to upload images, this website also supports uploading via image URLs.

## Running
To run this program locally, you need to prepare the following:
Node.js, React components, Docker
- For the Node.js, we can just download in official website: [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Docker can also be downloaded from the official website. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

For other components, we can proceed with the download directly.
After downloading these environments, we need to download the required components.
